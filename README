# rolling focus

Experiments in real-time merging low depth of field image series. 

In particular taking pictures through a microscope, using an android device.
DOF in microscopy is very low, hence the need to apply focus stacking. 

I often 
want to apply enfuse on image stacks of up to 300 pictures, which is 
prohibitively slow for a live preview. I therefore resorted to OpenCV to produce
quick-and-dirty focus detection and crop and paste the results along the 
detected areas. The result is a pasted focus stack, as opposed to a 
blended/fused focus stack.

### Example

soon.

### Setup

soon.

### Requirements

* adb connection to your android device
* python3-opencv for the live preview
* enfuse for the final results
